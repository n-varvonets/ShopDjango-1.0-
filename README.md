# ShopDjango-1.0-
In order to view the working online web site with internal business logic (the ability to add and remove products from the cart, change their quantity and make orders) you need to be a registered user. In the next version of the online store will be added the ability to register and authorize the user, but at the moment I suggest you register as an administrator. To do this, go to https://shop-django-v1.herokuapp.com/admin/ and enter the following data:
-Username: Nick 
-Password: 19835168
Now you are already a registered user and can use the functionality provided by the online store on the link https://shop-django-v1.herokuapp.com.
